# Tasks to perform

# Task 1: Identify Top Students by Total Scores
# Use a subquery to calculate the total score (math_score + science_score +english_score) for each student.
# Use an ORDER BY clause to rank students by their total scores in descending order.
# Limit the results to show only the top students (e.g., top 5).

SELECT StudentID, Name, Total_Score  
FROM (  
    SELECT StudentID, Name, (MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) AS Total_Score  
    FROM Students1  
) AS Total_Score_Of_Students  
ORDER BY Total_Score DESC  
LIMIT 5;

# Task 2: Calculate Averages Based on Specific Conditions
# Use subqueries to filter and group data for average calculations:
# Example 1: Calculate the average score of students who scored above 70 in Math.
# Example 2: Calculate the average total score of students grouped by a specific condition, 
#            such as a score range (e.g., students scoring 200â€“250 in total).

SELECT AVG(MathScore) AS average_math_score  
FROM Students1  
WHERE MathScore > 70;

# Task 3: Find Second-Highest Math Scores
# Use a subquery to determine the highest Math score and exclude it in a second query to 
#      find the next highest value.
# Example:
# Use MAX(math_score) in a subquery to find the highest score.
# Use WHERE math_score < (SELECT MAX(math_score) FROM Students) to exclude the top score and then use MAX again to find the second highest score. 

SELECT AVG(Total_Score) AS average_total_score  
FROM (  
    SELECT (MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) AS total_score  
    FROM Students1  
) AS Total_Scores  
WHERE total_score BETWEEN 200 AND 250;

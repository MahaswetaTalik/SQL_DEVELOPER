SQL Developer Internship Experience

During my SQL Developer Internship, I gained hands-on experience in designing and optimizing relational databases, writing complex queries, and ensuring high data integrity across diverse systems. My responsibilities included:
- Developing and refining SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and reporting tasks
- Collaborating with data analysts to build efficient data pipelines and support business intelligence
- Implementing indexing strategies, normalization techniques, and performance tuning for large datasets
- Assisting in database troubleshooting, query profiling, and resolving data inconsistencies
- Working with stored procedures, triggers, and views to automate database operations
This internship strengthened my ability to think analytically, write production-ready SQL code, and contribute effectively to data-centric projects. It also deepened my understanding of enterprise data environments and reinforced best practices in database development.
